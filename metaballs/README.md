# Metaballs

Once again I found out about this cool graphics thing from "The Coding Train"
channel. The is one of the earlier videos in the series - 
["Coding Challenge #28: Metaballs"][1].

I watched the video, liked it a lot and given I'm studying graphics and making
all these shader things these days I thought I'm going to implemented this
in love2d and then if possible do it entirely in shaders if possible. I know
that my "shader-foo" is quite weak at the moment. But I would love to fail and
then come back and accomplish this later if needed.

Let's go!
